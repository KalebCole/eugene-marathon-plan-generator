# Heart Rate Zones Guide

This guide explains how heart rate zones are calculated and used in the training plan.

## Why Train with Heart Rate?

Heart rate provides an objective measure of intensity that accounts for:
- **Fatigue** - Same pace feels harder when tired
- **Heat/Humidity** - External factors that affect effort
- **Terrain** - Hills require more effort at slower paces
- **Recovery status** - Helps prevent overtraining

It's especially useful for ensuring easy runs are actually easy.

## Zone Calculation Methods

### Method 1: Percentage of Max HR (Simpler)

If you only know your Max HR:

| Zone | % of Max HR | Heart Rate Range |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Zone 1 (Recovery) | 50-60% | Max x 0.50 to Max x 0.60 |
| Zone 2 (Easy) | 60-70% | Max x 0.60 to Max x 0.70 |
| Zone 3 (Tempo) | 70-80% | Max x 0.70 to Max x 0.80 |
| Zone 4 (Threshold) | 80-90% | Max x 0.80 to Max x 0.90 |
| Zone 5 (VO2max) | 90-100% | Max x 0.90 to Max |

**Example (Max HR = 185):**
- Zone 1: 93-111 bpm
- Zone 2: 111-130 bpm
- Zone 3: 130-148 bpm
- Zone 4: 148-167 bpm
- Zone 5: 167-185 bpm

### Method 2: Percentage of LTHR (More Accurate)

If you know your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate:

| Zone | % of LTHR | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Zone 1 (Recovery) | <80% | Very easy |
| Zone 2 (Easy) | 80-90% | Conversational |
| Zone 3 (Tempo) | 90-100% | Comfortably hard |
| Zone 4 (Threshold) | 100-105% | Race pace effort |
| Zone 5 (VO2max) | >105% | Near maximum |

**Example (LTHR = 168):**
- Zone 1: <134 bpm
- Zone 2: 134-151 bpm
- Zone 3: 151-168 bpm
- Zone 4: 168-176 bpm
- Zone 5: >176 bpm

### Method 3: Heart Rate Reserve (Karvonen Formula)

Most accurate, uses both Max HR and Resting HR:

**Target HR = (Max HR - Resting HR) x %intensity + Resting HR**

**Example (Max = 185, Resting = 52):**
- HR Reserve = 185 - 52 = 133
- Zone 2 (60-70%): 52 + (133 x 0.60) to 52 + (133 x 0.70) = 132-145 bpm

## Finding Your HR Data in Garmin

### Max Heart Rate

1. Open Garmin Connect (app or web)
2. Go to **Performance Stats** or **Training Status**
3. Look for "Max HR" in your metrics
4. Also check your hardest recent efforts for actual max reached

**If not accurate:** Run a Max HR field test:
1. Warm up 10-15 minutes
2. Run 3-4 minutes hard uphill (max effort last 30 sec)
3. Check peak HR recorded

### Lactate Threshold HR

1. In Garmin Connect, go to **Training Status**
2. Look for "Lactate Threshold" metrics
3. If you've done a guided test, it will show your LTHR
4. Some watches auto-detect this from hard workouts

**If not available:** Use the 30-minute test:
1. Warm up 10 minutes
2. Run 30 minutes as hard as sustainably possible
3. Average HR for last 20 minutes ≈ LTHR

### Resting Heart Rate

1. Go to **Health Stats** > **Heart Rate**
2. Check your "Resting HR" reading
3. Best measured first thing in the morning
4. Use the 7-day average for most accuracy

## Zone-to-Workout Mapping

| Workout Type | Target Zone | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Recovery run | Zone 1 | Very easy, active recovery |
| Easy run | Zone 2 | Conversational pace |
| Long run | Zone 2 | May drift to Zone 3 near end |
| Tempo run | Zone 3-4 | Comfortably hard |
| Threshold intervals | Zone 4 | At or just below threshold |
| VO2max intervals | Zone 4-5 | Hard but sustainable for interval |
| Sprint intervals | Zone 5 | Near maximum |

---

## Zone Purposes

### Zone 1: Recovery (50-60% Max HR)
**Purpose:** Active recovery, blood flow promotion
**Feel:** Very easy, could run all day
**Use for:** Recovery runs, warm-up/cool-down

### Zone 2: Aerobic/Easy (60-70% Max HR)
**Purpose:** Build aerobic base, fat burning
**Feel:** Conversational, comfortable
**Use for:** Easy runs, most of long run
**Key:** Most training should be here (~80% of total volume)

### Zone 3: Tempo (70-80% Max HR)
**Purpose:** Improve lactate clearance, marathon pace
**Feel:** Comfortably hard, can speak short sentences
**Use for:** Tempo runs, marathon pace work

### Zone 4: Threshold (80-90% Max HR)
**Purpose:** Raise lactate threshold, race fitness
**Feel:** Hard, limited speaking
**Use for:** Tempo intervals, threshold workouts

### Zone 5: VO2max (90-100% Max HR)
**Purpose:** Maximum aerobic capacity
**Feel:** Very hard, can't speak
**Use for:** Short intervals, hill repeats, race kicks

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Running Easy Runs Too Fast
**Problem:** Most runners spend too much time in Zone 3
**Solution:** Be disciplined about keeping easy runs in Zone 2, even if it feels slow

### 2. Using Zones Blindly
**Problem:** HR lags behind effort changes
**Solution:**
- For intervals: Go by pace/effort, not HR
- For easy runs: HR is very useful
- For long runs: Use HR but expect drift

### 3. Not Accounting for Cardiac Drift
**Problem:** HR rises naturally during long runs even at same effort
**Solution:** Accept Zone 3 in last 20-30% of long runs

### 4. Not Adjusting for Heat
**Problem:** HR runs 10-20 bpm higher in heat
**Solution:** Go by effort feel in hot weather, not absolute HR

## Applying HR Zones to Your Plan

### Easy Run Example
**Workout:** Easy 5 miles
**HR Target:** Zone 2 (e.g., 130-145 bpm)
**Strategy:**
- Start slow, let HR settle
- If HR climbs to Zone 3, slow down
- It's okay to walk uphills to stay in zone

### Long Run Example
**Workout:** Long 16 miles
**HR Target:** Zone 2, allowing Zone 3 in final miles
**Strategy:**
- First 2/3: Stay firmly in Zone 2
- Last 1/3: Allow drift into low Zone 3
- If HR spikes early, something's wrong (hydration, sleep, etc.)

### Tempo Run Example
**Workout:** 3 miles at tempo pace
**HR Target:** Zone 3-4
**Strategy:**
- Warmup: Zone 1-2
- Tempo: Settle into Zone 3, may reach Zone 4
- Use pace as primary guide, HR as secondary check
- Cooldown: Zone 1-2

### Interval Example
**Workout:** 8 x 400m at 5K pace
**HR Target:** Zone 4-5 during intervals
**Strategy:**
- HR will lag - don't wait for it
- Go by pace for work intervals
- Recovery: Let HR drop to Zone 2 before next rep
- Check HR pattern across workout

## Quick Reference Card

| If you're doing... | Target Zone | If HR is too high... |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Easy run | Zone 2 | Slow down, walk if needed |
| Long run | Zone 2 (→3 late) | Accept some drift, stay aerobic |
| Tempo | Zone 3-4 | Good - you're working hard |
| Intervals | Zone 4-5 | Let pace guide you, not HR |
| Recovery | Zone 1 | Stay very relaxed |
