# Strength Training Integration Guide

This guide explains how strength training is integrated into the marathon training plan for an experienced lifter.

## Philosophy

For experienced lifters, the plan provides **timing and periodization guidance** rather than exercise selection. You know what exercises work for you - the plan helps you know when and how much.

---

## Training Phase Periodization

Strength training volume and intensity decrease as running volume increases:

| Phase | Weeks | Lifting Days | Focus | Intensity |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Base | 1-4 | 3x/week | General strength | Normal |
| Build | 5-10 | 2-3x/week | Running-specific | Moderate |
| Peak | 11-13 | 2x/week | Maintenance | Light-moderate |
| Taper | 14-15 | 1x/week | Mobility + light | Very light |
| Race Week | 16 | Optional mobility | Just movement | Minimal |

## Weekly Integration Rules

### Critical Sequencing Rules

1. **No heavy legs within 48 hours of speed work**
   - Intervals, tempo runs, and races need fresh legs
   - Heavy squats/deadlifts compromise running quality

2. **Lift AFTER runs, not before (same day)**
   - Running performance suffers after lifting
   - Lifting after running is fine for adaptation

3. **No lifting the day before long runs**
   - Long runs are key workouts
   - Start them with fresh, recovered legs

4. **Upper body is more flexible**
   - Can be done most days without impacting running
   - Just avoid exhausting yourself before hard runs

### Sample Week Integration

**Moderate Phase (Build weeks):**

| Day | Running | Lifting |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Monday | Easy 5mi | Upper body (evening) |
| Tuesday | Tempo 6mi | - |
| Wednesday | Easy 4mi | Lower body (light) |
| Thursday | Rest | - |
| Friday | Easy 4mi | - |
| Saturday | Cross-train or Rest | Full body (optional) |
| Sunday | Long run 14mi | - |

## Running-Specific Strength Focus

As a marathon runner, prioritize these movement patterns:

### Lower Body (Most Important)

| Exercise Category | Examples | Why It Matters |
|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| Single-leg work | Lunges, step-ups, Bulgarian splits, pistols | Running is single-leg; bilateral strength doesn't transfer as well |
| Hip extension | Romanian deadlifts, hip thrusts, glute bridges | Power for hill climbing, late-race strength |
| Calf strength | Standing/seated raises, tibialis raises | Injury prevention, push-off power |

### Core

| Exercise Category | Examples | Why It Matters |
|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| Anti-rotation | Pallof press, bird dogs | Rotational stability during running |
| Anti-extension | Planks, dead bugs, ab wheel | Prevents energy leaks at pelvis |
| Hip stability | Clamshells, side-lying leg raises, monster walks | Prevents knee/IT band issues |

### Upper Body

| Exercise Category | Examples | Why It Matters |
|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| Pulling | Rows, pull-ups, face pulls | Posture for late-race fatigue |
| Pushing | Push-ups, overhead press | Balance, general fitness |
| Arm drive | Light arm swings, resistance band work | Running economy |

## Phase-Specific Guidelines

### Base Phase (Weeks 1-4)
- **Goal:** Build/maintain overall strength
- **Volume:** Your normal training volume
- **Exercises:** Whatever you enjoy, including heavy compound lifts
- **Timing:** Flexible - work around running as usual

### Build Phase (Weeks 5-10)
- **Goal:** Transition to running-specific strength
- **Volume:** Reduce total sets by 20-30%
- **Exercises:** Shift toward single-leg and core work
- **Timing:** No heavy legs within 48hrs of workouts
- **Key change:** Prioritize recovery for running

### Peak Phase (Weeks 11-13)
- **Goal:** Maintain without adding fatigue
- **Volume:** Reduce to 50% of base phase
- **Exercises:** Focus on injury prevention and mobility
- **Timing:** Light sessions only, never before long runs
- **Key change:** Lifting should never make you sore

### Taper Phase (Weeks 14-15)
- **Goal:** Keep muscles activated, reduce load
- **Volume:** 1 session per week maximum
- **Exercises:** Light movements, mobility, form work
- **Timing:** Early in the week
- **Key change:** Any soreness = too much

## Recovery Considerations

### Signs You're Doing Too Much Lifting
- Running paces feel harder than they should
- Persistent leg soreness
- Elevated resting heart rate
- Poor sleep
- Decreased motivation

### Adjustments to Make
1. Reduce lifting volume first (fewer sets)
2. Reduce intensity second (lighter weight)
3. Add more rest days between lifting sessions
4. Focus on upper body if legs are fatigued

---

## Sample Sessions by Phase

### Build Phase - Lower Body (30-40 min)
```
Warm-up: 5 min light cardio + dynamic stretching

1. Bulgarian Split Squats: 3x8 each leg (moderate weight)
2. Romanian Deadlifts: 3x10 (moderate weight)
3. Calf Raises: 3x15
4. Clamshells: 2x15 each side
5. Dead Bugs: 2x10 each side

Cool-down: Light stretching
```

### Build Phase - Upper Body (25-30 min)
```
Warm-up: 5 min + arm circles

1. Pull-ups or Rows: 3x8-10
2. Push-ups or Bench: 3x10-12
3. Face Pulls: 3x15
4. Pallof Press: 2x10 each side
5. Planks: 2x30-45 sec

Cool-down: Light stretching
```

### Peak/Taper - Maintenance (20-25 min)
```
Warm-up: 5 min light movement

1. Bodyweight Squats: 2x15
2. Single-leg RDL (light): 2x8 each
3. Push-ups: 2x10
4. Band Pull-aparts: 2x15
5. Core circuit: planks, bird dogs, dead bugs (1 set each)

Cool-down: Full mobility routine
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Running is the priority** - Lifting supports running, not the other way around
2. **Less is more** as race approaches - Reduce volume progressively
3. **Single-leg > bilateral** for running transfer
4. **Never sacrifice running quality** for lifting
5. **Recovery matters more than the work itself** during peak training
