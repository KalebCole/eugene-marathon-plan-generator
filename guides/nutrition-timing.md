# Nutrition & TDEE Guide

This guide explains how the training plan calculates your daily calorie and macro targets, and provides guidance on meal timing around workouts.

## TDEE Calculation

Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is calculated in three steps:

### Step 1: Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

Using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation:

**Male:** BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age) + 5

**Female:** BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age) - 161

### Step 2: Activity Multiplier

Your base TDEE = BMR x activity multiplier

| Activity Level | Multiplier | Description |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Sedentary | 1.2 | Desk job, minimal movement |
| Lightly Active | 1.375 | Light walking, some standing |
| Moderately Active | 1.55 | On your feet, some physical work |
| Very Active | 1.725 | Physical job + active lifestyle |

### Step 3: Training Day Adjustments

Add calories burned from training:

| Workout Type | Calories per Mile/Session |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Easy run | 80-100 cal/mile |
| Long run | 100-120 cal/mile |
| Tempo/Intervals | 100-110 cal/mile |
| Strength (30min) | 100-150 cal |
| Strength (60min) | 200-300 cal |

### Example Calculation

**Athlete:** Male, 32 years old, 5'10" (178cm), 165 lbs (75kg), desk job

1. **BMR** = (10 x 75) + (6.25 x 178) - (5 x 32) + 5 = 1,708 cal
2. **Base TDEE** = 1,708 x 1.2 = 2,050 cal
3. **Training Days:**
   - Rest day: 2,050 cal
   - Easy 5-mile run: 2,050 + 450 = 2,500 cal
   - Long 16-mile run: 2,050 + 1,760 = 3,810 cal
   - Tempo 6mi + Lift: 2,050 + 660 + 150 = 2,860 cal

## Macro Distribution

| Macro | % of Calories | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Carbohydrates | 50-55% | Primary fuel for running |
| Protein | 20-25% | Muscle repair and recovery |
| Fat | 25-30% | Hormones, satiety, cell function |

### Daily Gram Targets (Example: 2,500 cal day)

| Macro | % | Calories | Grams |
|-------|---|----------|-------|
| Carbs | 55% | 1,375 | 344g |
| Protein | 23% | 575 | 144g |
| Fat | 22% | 550 | 61g |

### Training Day Adjustments

- **High-volume days (long runs):** Increase carbs to 55-60%
- **Strength-focused days:** Prioritize protein
- **Rest days:** Can reduce carbs slightly, maintain protein

## Workout-Specific Timing

### Easy Run (< 60 minutes)

| Timing | What to Eat |
|--------|-------------|
| Pre-workout | Optional light snack if hungry |
| During | Water only |
| Post-workout | Normal meal within 2 hours |

### Long Run (> 90 minutes)

| Timing | What to Eat |
|--------|-------------|
| 2-3 hours before | 200-300 cal meal (oatmeal, banana, toast) |
| During | 30-60g carbs/hour starting at 45-60 min |
| Post-workout | Recovery shake within 30 min + full meal within 2 hours |

**During-run fueling options:**
- Energy gels (1 every 45 min)
- Chews/gummies
- Sports drink
- Real food (dates, banana pieces)

### Tempo/Intervals

| Timing | What to Eat |
|--------|-------------|
| 1-2 hours before | 100-200 cal (banana, toast, small bar) |
| During | Water, gel if > 60 min |
| Post-workout | Protein + carbs within 30 min |

### Strength Training

| Timing | What to Eat |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 hour before | Light snack with protein + carbs |
| During | Water |
| Post-workout | Protein-focused meal/shake within 1 hour |

## Race Day Fueling Protocol

### Night Before
- Carb-focused dinner (pasta, rice, potatoes)
- Adequate hydration
- Familiar foods only

### Race Morning (3-4 hours before)
- 300-500 cal breakfast
- Low fiber, low fat
- Examples: Toast with honey, banana, oatmeal with minimal toppings
- 16-20 oz water/sports drink

### 1 Hour Before Start
- 100-200 cal (banana, gel, sports drink)
- Final bathroom stop

### During Race
- Start fueling at miles 3-4
- 30-60g carbs per hour
- Take with water
- Stick to what you practiced in training

### Hydration During Race
- 4-8 oz every 15-20 minutes
- Mix water and sports drink
- Take advantage of aid stations

## Common Supplements for Marathon Training

| Supplement | Purpose | When to Use |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Electrolytes | Replace sodium/potassium lost in sweat | Long runs, hot days, race day |
| Caffeine | Performance boost, mental alertness | Race day, key workouts (not daily) |
| Protein powder | Convenient post-workout recovery | After hard workouts when real food isn't available |
| Creatine | May support strength adaptations | Daily if lifting regularly (5g/day) |
| Iron | Supports oxygen transport | Only if deficient (test first) |
| Vitamin D | Many runners are deficient | Fall/winter especially |

**Note:** Food first, supplements second. Get nutrition from real food when possible.

## Practical Tips

1. **Practice race fueling** - Use long runs to test gels, timing, and stomach tolerance
2. **Nothing new on race day** - Only eat foods you've tested in training
3. **Stay consistent** - Hit your calorie targets most days
4. **Hydrate proactively** - Don't wait until you're thirsty
5. **Protein timing matters less than total** - Focus on hitting daily protein goals
6. **Carbs are your friend** - Don't fear carbs during marathon training
