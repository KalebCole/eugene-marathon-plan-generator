Hey! I'm building a comprehensive training plan system for your
Eugene Marathon. Need some info to generate personalized options:

RUNNING
1. What was your recent half marathon time? (or any recent race)
2. What days/times can you run?
   - Weekday availability (e.g., "mornings before 7am")
   - Weekend availability
3. How many hours/week total for training (running + lifting)?

HEART RATE (from Garmin)
4. What's your max HR? (Check Garmin Connect > Performance Stats)
5. Do you have a lactate threshold HR? (If tested)
6. Resting HR?

STRENGTH TRAINING
7. How many days/week do you want to lift?
8. Preferred lifting days/times?
9. Any exercises you want to include or avoid?

BODY & NUTRITION
10. Height and weight?
11. Age?
12. Gender (for calorie calculation)?
13. Activity level outside training? (desk job, on your feet, etc.)
14. Any dietary restrictions or preferences?

SCHEDULE
16. Any dates you'll be unavailable? (travel, events)
17. What's your goal for Eugene?
    - Just finish comfortably
    - Target a specific time
    - Push for best possible performance

## Example Responses

**Good response:**
> RUNNING
> 1. 1:52:30 half marathon last October
> 2. Weekdays I can do mornings before 7am (M/W/F) or Tuesday evenings. Weekends are flexible but Sundays work best for long runs.
> 3. About 8-10 hours total
>
> HEART RATE
> 4. Max HR is 185 according to Garmin
> 5. LTHR is 168 from a threshold test
> 6. Resting is around 52
>
> STRENGTH
> 7. 2-3 days lifting
> 8. Tuesday and Thursday evenings work best, maybe Saturday
> 9. No heavy squats the day before a long run
>
> BODY & NUTRITION
> 10. 5'10", 165 lbs
> 11. 32
> 12. Male
> 13. Desk job, mostly sedentary outside training
> 14. No restrictions, try to eat clean
> 15. Creatine and protein powder
>
> SCHEDULE
> 16. Traveling Feb 15-22, wedding March 8
> 17. Target sub-4:00 if realistic

**Minimal response (still workable):**
> 1. Did a half in about 2 hours
> 2. Can run most days, prefer mornings
> 3. 6-7 hours total
> 4. Max HR around 180 I think
> 5. Don't know LTHR
> 6. Resting ~55
> 7. 2 days lifting
> 8. Evenings
> 9. Nothing specific
> 10. 5'9", 170 lbs
> 11. 35
> 12. Male
> 13. Office job
> 14. None
> 15. Just protein powder

## How Responses Map to Plan Generation

### Running & Performance
| Question | What It Determines |
|----------|-------------------|
| Race time | Pace zones, finish time predictions |
| Available days | Which days get which workout types |
| Weekly hours | Plan intensity level, total volume |
| Goal | How aggressive the predictions/plan |

### Heart Rate
| Question | What It Determines |
|----------|-------------------|
| Max HR | HR zone ceilings (Zone 5 = 90-100% Max) |
| LTHR | More accurate zones if available |
| Resting HR | Heart rate reserve calculations |

### Strength Training
| Question | What It Determines |
|----------|-------------------|
| Days/week | Lifting frequency in plan |
| Preferred times | Integration with running schedule |
| Preferences | Sequencing rules (e.g., no legs before long run) |

### Nutrition (TDEE Calculation)
| Question | What It Determines |
|----------|-------------------|
| Height/Weight | BMR calculation |
| Age | BMR adjustment |
| Sex | BMR formula selection |
| Activity level | Base TDEE multiplier |
| Restrictions | Food recommendations |
| Supplements | What to include/recommend |

### Schedule
| Question | What It Determines |
|----------|-------------------|
| Blocked dates | When to shift/compress training |
| Goal | Plan aggressiveness, finish time targets |

## Garmin Connect HR Data Location

To find HR data in Garmin Connect:
1. Open Garmin Connect app or website
2. Go to **Performance Stats** or **Health Stats**
3. Look for:
   - **Max HR**: Often auto-detected from hard efforts
   - **Lactate Threshold HR**: Under Training Status (if you've done a threshold test)
   - **Resting HR**: Under Health Stats > Heart Rate

If Max HR isn't accurate, a simple field test:
1. Warm up 10-15 minutes
2. Run hard uphill for 2-3 minutes
3. Check the peak HR recorded
